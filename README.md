# HACKTECH2.0
# Robotic Companion for Elderly Care
### Solution:
##### The proposed solution integrates a Raspberry Pi 4 or NVIDIA Jetson Nano for computational tasks, while an Arduino Uno controls the robot's motion using a line following kit. Serial communication facilitates seamless coordination between the microcontroller and single-board computer. The Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano manages high-level functions like medication scheduling, reminder alerts, gesture recognition, and GPS-based location tracking, enhancing the robot's ability to assist elderly residents. Meanwhile, the Arduino Uno interprets sensor data, controls motors, and navigates the robot along predefined paths, ensuring smooth movement within the environment. This combination of hardware provides a versatile and robust platform for developing a sophisticated robotic system tailored to the needs of old age homes and elderly individuals living at home. With computational power, real-time control, and autonomous navigation capabilities, the robot promises to enhance the quality of care and support provided to the elderly, improving their safety, well-being, and overall quality of life.
